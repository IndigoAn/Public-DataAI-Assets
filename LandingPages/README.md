# Landing Pages

The idea of a landing page is that it is a collection of text and links to **high quality** collateral that people will find useful.  This can be blog posts, articles, GitHub repositories, tools, utlities, etc.

The collection of landing pages here should be thought of as a collection of pointers to "best practices" in the world of Cognitive Software development.

If you find "broken" links, or links to outdated materials, please be a good citizen and remove the content.
