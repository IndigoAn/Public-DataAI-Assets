# Watson Assistant Update Tool

## About

The Watson Assistant Update Tool is a Node.js application that will accept a skill ID, API key, and skill .json file and update your existing skill with changes from the new, uploaded skill.

### Structure

The project contains 2 parts: the client and the API. Each of the two folders has a corresponding README.md that will tell you how to install and run the application. It is advisable to start the API before the client.
