# Customer Assist (Chatbot) Journey

The Customer Assist Journey is a rough story of what most organizations that develop a Customer Assist chatbot will go through.  We highlight the various phases of this journey, and try to give you the information that you need to make this journey as smooth as possible.  Knowing what your journey involves allows you to plan better, and to be more proactive in addressing challenges - there are fewer "surprises".

This page is always in an "under construction" mode, as we remove links that are no longer relevant, and add links to new relevant materials.  The idea here is not to give you EVERY possible link on a topic, but instead to steer you to content that is high quality, and that has been applied in the real world.
