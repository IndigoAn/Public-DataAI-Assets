# Landing Pages

The idea of a landing page is that it is a collection of text and links to **high quality** collateral that people will find useful.  This can be blog posts, articles, GitHub repositories, tools, utlities, etc.

The collection of landing pages here should be thought of as a collection of pointers to "best practices" in the world of Cognitive Software development.  we have three different flavors of Landing Pages.
- **By Journey** - This follows a happy path of typical adoption and usage of the various AI capabilities.  Kind of conversational, and it follows a story.
- **By Technology** - This is a bit more conversational, giving some backgorund and guidance in addition to links to various different resources.  Geared towards the technical user who wants to learn all about some part of the technology stack.
- **By Service or Product** - This is "just the facts".  Links to high value materials are provided in a list format, without a real story linking them.  Just some explanation of what they are.

If you find "broken" links, or links to outdated materials, please be a good citizen and remove the content.
