# Watson CSM's Common Collateral

This is a collection of scripts, notebooks, and projects developed by CSMs within the Data & AI organization. Please add each project to a SEPARATE folder, and please place it in the general area where it belongs.  When adding content, don't just dump it in here - make sure that you add a line to the appropriate README file that has a link to the tool, the author name, the date created/updated, and a short description of your tool or utility.  Don't forget to mention what environments it runs in and what languages it uses.
Example of README entry:
- [Watson Environment Script]() - D. Toczala - February 2020 - This will create a suitable environment for doing Watson Development activities on the IBM Cloud.  This bash script can be run by itself from any machine with the IBM Cloud Command Line Client installed.  You need to provide IAM creds for your administrator account.
