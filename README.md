# PUBLIC Watson CSM's Common Collateral

This is a collection of scripts, notebooks, and projects developed by IBM CSMs within the Data & AI organization. The goal of this repository is to capture some best practices and useful tools and utilities, as well as provide a place where people can learn and discover how to make more effective use of the IBM Watson capabilities.

## Community Guidelines

### Where to Place Your Project

Please add each project to a SEPARATE folder, and please place it in the general area where it belongs. For example, a Watson Studio notebook that analyzes Watson Assistant chat logs should belong in the Watson Assistant directory.
If there is a need to create a project in this repository to track collaborator contributions, and to coordinated activities, please go and create a project, buyt please give it a descriptive name (and not something like "Tox's Cool project").

### README

When adding content, don't just dump it in here - document it.  If you are updating a page of links, no updates may be needed.  For code, tools, and utilities, make sure that you have a README page with appropriate contetns describing what the tool or utility does, as well as installation and usage instructions.  Also make sure that you add a line to the appropriate README file in the repository.  This could be on this README page, on the README page for a specific service, on one or more of the [Landing Pages](), or **ALL** of the above.
Your README should contain the following items:
- Link to the tool
- The author's/owner's name and contact information
- The date created/updated,
- Short description of your tool or utility
- Instructions on how to run your project

Example of README entry:
- [Watson Environment Script]() - D. Toczala - February 2020 - This will create a suitable environment for doing Watson Development activities on the IBM Cloud.  This bash script can be run by itself from any machine with the IBM Cloud Command Line Client installed.  You need to provide IAM creds for your administrator account.
